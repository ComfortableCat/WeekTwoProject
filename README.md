# WeekTwoProject
I felt like I was able to achieve all requirements technically.
I feel as though I could have done better sorting out the media queries at lower resolutions as it doesnt feel quite right. Res < 400px wide
I am annoyed that srcset doesn't work I talked to tim about it and he didnt know why it wasnt working/ what was wrong and he told me that I should move on and it would be okay.(As srcset wasn't working I decided against having portrait images in the set)
I feel as though the javascript could be written better especially for the OnClick thumbnail navigation as it is limited to only having 5 sources at the moment with no abillity to expand.
I did aria attributes and did some extra reading on aria but i was unable to fully incorporate it in a way that felt satisfying and feel as though I should of had more to add (I feel as though everything I added was about all there could be, backed up by lighthouse)

I had originally had plans to allow for clicking of half the screen to rotate through images but was unable to fulfill this concept as I both ran out of time and didn't manage to mentally figure out when/how it should be added. I feel I should have done a device query if thats a thing but too late.

I have allowed myself less time than I wanted for this project. This is so I can focus on the other handin and to try and give myself the concept of a weekend (as was suggested by a friend)

All in all I feel as though I have completed the requirements and am happy with the work.
